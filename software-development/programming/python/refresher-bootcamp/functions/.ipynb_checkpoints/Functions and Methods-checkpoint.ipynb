    "# Python Functions and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, functions and methods are essential building blocks of programming. They allow you to organize your code into reusable blocks, making it easier to manage and maintain. Functions and methods serve a similar purpose, but they are used in different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's start with functions. In Python, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called multiple times throughout a program. Functions provide modularity and encapsulation, allowing you to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the basic syntax of a function in Python:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    # Code block\n",
    "    # Perform operations\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `def` is the keyword used to define a function.\n",
    "- `function_name` is the identifier that uniquely identifies the function. You can choose any valid name according to Python naming conventions.\n",
    "- `parameters / arguments` are optional inputs that the function can accept. They are enclosed in parentheses and can be used to pass data to the function for processing.\n",
    "    - **postional arguments**: `*args`\n",
    "        * Used to pass variable amounts of arguments to a method or function\n",
    "    - **keyword arguments**: `**kwargs`\n",
    "        * Used to pass variable amounts of keyword arguments to a method or function in the form as key/val pairs\n",
    "        * Given this constraint, this means you can pass a dictionary as an argument and the function will unpack\n",
    "        each entry\n",
    "- The code block is indented and contains the instructions and logic that define the behavior of the function.\n",
    "- `return` statement specifies the value that the function will produce as output. It is optional, and if omitted, the function will return None by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's an example of a function that adds two numbers `a` and `b` as positional arguments:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    result = a + b\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's an example of an adder function that takes a variable length of positional arguments**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_variable_nums(*args):\n",
    "    if len(args) < 1:\n",
    "        return\n",
    "   \n",
    "    sum = 0\n",
    "    for i in args:\n",
    "        sum += i\n",
    "    return sum\n",
    "\n",
    "add_variable_nums(1, 5, 10, 55) # yields 71\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's an example of a function that calculates the area of a rectangle using keyword arguments `**kwargs`**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_area(**kwargs):\n",
    "    width = kwargs.w\n",
    "    height = kwargs.h\n",
    "    return width * height\n",
    "\n",
    "area = calculate_area({\"w\": 10, \"h\":5})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call this function by providing the required arguments:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sum = add_numbers(2, 3)\n",
    "print(sum)  # Output: 5\n",

    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, methods are functions that are associated with objects or classes. They are similar to functions, but they are called on specific instances of objects or classes and can access the data and attributes associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a method within a class:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, {self.name}!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__` is a special method called a constructor. It initializes the object and sets its initial state.\n",
    "greet is a method that belongs to the MyClass class. It takes no arguments other than self, which represents the instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the method, you first need to create an instance of the class:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "obj = MyClass(\"John\")\n",
    "obj.greet()  # Output: Hello, John!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> As you can see, the method greet is called on the obj instance of MyClass using the dot notation (obj.greet()).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods can also take additional arguments besides self, just like regular functions. They can manipulate the object's data or perform other operations associated with the instance."

    "### Idiomatic Python Code\n",
    "- Idiomatic means standard, accepted readable code as it pertains to the language used. In our case, idiomatic code in Python is said to be \"Pythonic code\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Some idomatic rules are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions and methods should use `_` to delimit the names of such methods or functions. Python does not use camelCase or SnakeCase**\n",
    "- Docstrings should be used in the function/method bodies rather than above the definition\n",
    "- **Use meaningful variable and function names: Choose descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable or function. This makes your code more readable and helps others understand its intent.**\n",
    "- Follow PEP 8 guidelines: PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code. Adhering to these guidelines improves code consistency. Some key points include using 4 spaces for indentation, limiting line length to 79 characters, and following naming conventions (e.g., lowercase with underscores for variable and function names).\n",
    "- Prefer list comprehensions and generator expressions: Python provides concise ways to create lists and generators using comprehensions. Instead of manually appending items in a loop, use comprehensions for more readable and efficient code.\n",
    "- Use context managers and the `with` statement: When working with resources that need to be properly managed (e.g., files, network connections), use context managers and the `with` statement. This ensures that resources are automatically released when they're no longer needed.\n",
    "- Leverage Python's built-in functions and modules: Python offers a rich standard library with many useful functions and modules. Before reinventing the wheel, check if there's a built-in function or module that can solve your problem more efficiently.\n",
    "- Avoid unnecessary repetition: Don't repeat code that serves the same purpose. Instead, encapsulate reusable code into functions or classes. This promotes code reuse and makes it easier to maintain and modify.\n",
    "- Handle exceptions gracefully: Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions. Avoid catching broad exceptions unless necessary, and provide meaningful error messages when raising exceptions.\n",
    "- Take advantage of Python's object-oriented features: Python supports object-oriented programming. Use classes and objects when it makes sense to organize related data and behavior.\n",
    "- Use virtual environments: When working on different projects, use virtual environments (venv, conda) to isolate dependencies and ensure project-specific package versions. Tools like venv or pipenv can help create and manage virtual environments.\n",
    "- Write testable code: Embrace unit testing by writing testable code. Split your code into small, modular functions and use testing frameworks (e.g., unittest, pytest) to create test cases that verify your code's correctness."
