    <!-- Angular uses the root element paradigm just like React, however it is not a div with a root className. In this case
  it is an app-root "element" that defines the root entrypoint for all the UI component code of the Angular application.
      This component is attached to by the app.component.ts file in the src/app folder, similar to app.jsx in React.
