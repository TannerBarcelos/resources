# Learning Golang

## Introduction

This is a folder to learn Golang from Laith Academy on YouTube. It is a very high-level, quick, and dirty introduction to the language. The goal is to get a basic understanding of the language and its syntax.

> **Note**: Much of the code is lacking comments and explanations. This is intentional. The goal is to get a basic understanding of the language and its syntax. The code is not meant to be production-ready or even necessarily good. It is meant to be a quick and dirty introduction to the language. I also have a lot of experience with other languages, so I am not starting from scratch. If you are new to programming, you may need to spend more time on each video and do more research on your own.
