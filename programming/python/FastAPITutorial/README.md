# Intro to FastAPI

## Getting Started

> This project uses virtual environments with Anaconda. If you do not have Anaconda installed, you can download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
>
> Also, these directions use `Make` commands. If you do not have `Make` installed, you can download it [here](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)

1. To install all the dependencies and create a virtual environment, run the following within your cwd ([read more here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/create.html))
   `Make create-env`

2. Activate the environment with the following
   `Make activate-env`

3. Run the Server

   > You can run the basic example or the advanced example. Both do the same thing, but the advanced example has more code and comments to help you understand what is going on for a more complex project.

- Basic Example
  `Make run-basic-server`

- Advanced Example
  `Make run-advanced-server`
