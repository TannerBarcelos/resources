This file explains data types

//Data Types: primitive and reference data types

//primitive types:
/**
 * String -> 'tanner'
 * Number -> 1, 1.0, 3.14
 * Boolean  -> true, false
 * Null     -> points to nothing
 * Undefined  -> has not been defined yet e.g: let name;   <- no value assignment, so it is in an undefined state
 * Symbols    ->ES6 feature
 */

 //Reference types
/**
 * Arrays: [1,2,3,4,5] <- typeof actually returns object because an array IS AN OBJECT
 * Object literal: const name = {'tanner':24}..    the wholeliterl object
 * Functions: =>, function(){}, etc.
 * Dates: date time, now etc.    const today = new Date();
 * Anything else that is not a primitive type (e.g user defined Abstract data types, etc.)
