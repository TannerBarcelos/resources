This file contains notes on variables

//Variables: var, const and let

var name = 'Tanner Barcelos';                 //global scope: can be reassigned anywhere, anytime
let newName = 'Hayden Barcelos';              //block scoped: they exist only in the scope of its block (Can also be global of course)
const USA = 'USA';                            //constant: cannot be reassigned


//initializing  variable
let name_;
//assigning that variable a value: JS is dynamic/weakly typed so it assumes the type at run time
name_ = 'Jon Doe'
console.log(name_)
