## Weather App

This is a learning project for me to learn Flask with Python. I am a NodeJS / TS and want to use Python more to do web backend stuff. So, I am learning Flask.

> Not using React / separate frontend for this project. I want to focus on the backend and the tutorial I am following is using Jinja2 templates.
