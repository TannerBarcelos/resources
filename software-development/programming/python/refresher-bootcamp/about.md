# About this repo

- I am a software engineer with 2+ years of experience + 4 years of college degree in computer science. However, I have not used Python in my day-to-day work since graduation, but I am now more involved in Big Data and want to refresh on the language.

- I used to use Python a lot so this repo and all the notebooks might contain some vague terms / notes because this notebook / repo is somewhat beginner friendly but more for experienced engineers who quickly want to learn some Python / need a quick reference

- These notes come from a Python Masterclass on Udemy taught by Jose Portilla but are written and elaborated in my own words / code examples
