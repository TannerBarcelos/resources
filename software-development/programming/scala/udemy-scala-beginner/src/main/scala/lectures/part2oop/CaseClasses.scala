  //  Notice how the keyword new was not used to instantiate the Book
  //  case class.This is because
  //  case classes have an apply method by default which takes care of object construction
  //
  //  When you create a case class with parameters , the parameters are public vals which are members of that class and as we know, immutable consts

  println(message1.sender)  // prints guillaume@quebec.ca
  //  message1.sender = "travis@washington.us"  // this line does not compile because cqse classes promote immutability!

  // toString methods are generated for us when using case classes. This is handy when you want a string representation of the object
  println(message1)
