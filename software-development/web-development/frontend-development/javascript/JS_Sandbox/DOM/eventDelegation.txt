we saw that we could clear all tasks on a todo list by grabbing the ul, and then
saving all its childre, converting that container to an array, then traversing that array removing that childre

but what happens when a user wants to delete any specific todo? We need to take into account all li's as we do 
not know which li they want to delete, so how can we handle this?

EVENT DELEGATION!

We put an event on a parent element, and delegate that event to all its children. Instead of bubbling up in event bubbling,
we actually 'bubble down' and every element gets the event, but only when the x icon is pressed, an event to remove this child fires. Pretty cool

This also applies for adding a new todo item to the list (dynamic changes that dont occur onload should use some form of event delegation)
