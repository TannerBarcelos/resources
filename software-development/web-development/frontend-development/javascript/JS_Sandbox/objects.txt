//object literal
const person_1 = {
  firstName: 'Tanner',

  age: 24,

//objects can have functions, nested objects, arrays etc. as key/values

//to access properties of an object from within that object, it works just like classes! We need to use 
// the 'this' keyword : see getBirthYear() which is a function that can be called that returns the year of birth
// based off current year - the users this.age (this users age)

//displaying object value from given indexed key
console.log(person_1['firstName'])

//the cleaner way to get a value
console.log(person_1.lastName)

console.log(person_1.age)

console.log(person_1.getBirthYear() - 1)

//go to MDN and read up on the date object to see all sorts of logic and methods
