let val = 5;


//output:
console.log(val); //5
console.log(typeof val);  //number
console.log(val.length) //undefined     

//convert number to string  -> can all be done inline like this
val = String(val);

any of the primitive types can be converted to strings (string is simply represents the given object as a sequence of characters)


//we can also use toString() which is more common for interview problems
let x = 22;
x = toString();
console.log(typeof x); <- string NOT NUMBER ANYMORE

//can use Number('10')  and parse the string number into an actual number! super console

toFixed(precisionVal) will represent the number to n fixed digits


NaN values will be returned if trying to convert booleans, null and undefined values to number, etc.


//we can also use parseInt() to parse an int from a string input that was an actual number
let y = '100'
let z = parseInt(y);
console.log(z) <- 100 , typeof z === Number!
