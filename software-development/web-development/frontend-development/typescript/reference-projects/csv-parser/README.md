### Notes on working with TS and NodeJS

- In order to work with TS and NodeJS, we need to install the types for the Node standard library from NPM. To do so enter the following command below

```bash
npm i @types/node
```

> This installs all type definition and signatures to use NodeJS standard library functions and tools with TS instead of natively supported JS
