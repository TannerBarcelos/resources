# Basic React List

### Why?

- This project is very simple yet very important. I often find myself confused on 'how to get the index of a list item in a mapped out list in react' or 'how can i bind event handlers inline for better performance on list items?' So, to answer these questions and make these questions answers easily accessible, I simply made a basic list application with a delete feature that can basically remove items that were clicked
- This is not a todo app. I have a MERN version of a todo in another repo. This is more of an educational resource to get a fast, full fledged example of what my questions can be answered like in code.

#### Happy Coding!
