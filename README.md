# Software Engineering Resources
This repository serves as a file and directory dump of things I have learned, am learning or will learn in the future. It contains topics such as 

* Web Development
* Big Data
* Devops
* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Databases

And so much more.

I take notes and manage things I learn locally, but I prefer version controlling everything I learn as I do hands on practice within courses, practice projects, etc. so this repository serves that purpose. 

> This repository is not a projects repo. Nothing here are pure projects I wish to showcase. Everything is organized and backed-up here, but nothing within this repo serves as a demo of work. To see demo of work, refer the other projects in this repository as **they are the demonstration of work by me**.
