tags will hve highest otder for style initially
    e.g:  nav{
      color:white
    }

    however, if that nav has a class, and we style itas so ..
    .navClass{
      color:green
    }

    classes have higher specificity thant he tag, so, its overriden

    further, since ID's are unique, ID's have highest specificity, thus
    if you have a element with an id and class, the ID attributes will override
    the style of class and tag itself

    if you want to override all specificity rules, and keep somthing important
    we can mark that property !important
    e.g

    .navClass{
      color: green !important;
    }

    #navID{
      color: blue;  //this would override class style, but, we marked class style important, thus, it is overriden
    }
