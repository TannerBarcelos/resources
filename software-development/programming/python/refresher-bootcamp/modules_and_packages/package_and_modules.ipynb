However, since real workloads for apps are done in IDE's and deployed as binaries to target environments, Jupyter is not used and therefore demonstrating how to download is imperative. See the linked Conda docs [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to learn more about the conda package and environment manager"
